If you are looking for the Watson SDK for Unity or the VR Speech Sandbox, they are now only available through GitHub and IBM Developer. Here are the links:

-   [Watson SDK for Unity](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/unity-sdk)
-   [VR Speech Sandbox](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/create-a-virtual-reality-speech-sandbox/) (in all its forms, including the addition of language translator)



### FAQ

Still need answers? Check out a few I’ve already answered a few times today. I may even update this list as more roll in.

#### Will this impact an existing project that already includes the SDK and/or the VR Speech Sandbox?

No. But if you want an updated version, you’ll need to grab it from GitHub.

#### Will the assets still be maintained?

Yes. There are no plans to deprecate maintenance on either the SDK or VR Speech Sandbox.

#### Can I submit feedback?

Feel free to report an issue or submit a PR in the respective repo.

#### Where can I find release notes for the SDK?

On the [repo wiki](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/unity-sdk/wiki)!

This is a great question, and ultimately why I think the SDK deserve to live on GitHub exclusively to keep it closer to the release notes. Our IBM Cloud services and SDKs are maintained and enhanced in an agile fashion, which means change happens often. Keeping the code closer to the release notes keeps you, dearest developer, in the know.

#### I’ve never used GitHub, how do I pull the SDK into my Unity project?

You can download the SDK and unzip it, then move it into your Unity project folder by dragging and dropping into your Project window or into the directory.

Alternatively, you can use the command line an \`git clone\` to your project directory but you’ll need to have git installed.

If any of that is intimidating, leave me a comment or DM me on Twitter.
