I built a couple versions of my first AR app. Unfortunately they range from stale to moderately functional. I’m working on carving out some time to update everything, but I feel like I’m fighting an uphill battle. 

So instead, I wanted to take the opportunity to not only update my [most recent AI AR demo](https://medium.com/@MissAmaraKay/zero-to-ar-ai-app-again-sort-of-86b10178681c) but to refine it. I wanted to fix up the animation, but also play with ARKit. It “worked” but I certainly could do better.

Before I dive into the tech bits, let me take a step back and talk about AR platforms.

Why Use an AR Platform?

  

### What is Vuforia?

Vuforia is built into Unity’s editor which makes it a great place to start your AR adventure. As a huge bonus, you can run it in the editor directly and deploy to different devices.

### What is ARKit?

  

### Are there any others? ARCore?
